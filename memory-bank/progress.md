## Completed Tasks
- Initialize project structure and files
- Define MCP Server core requirements
- Design system architecture and select technology stack
- Decide to develop based on MCP SDK
- Implement environment variable configuration
- Implement Mantis API client
- Add API authentication mechanism
- Implement error handling mechanism
- Implement 6 core tool functionalities
- Implement request caching mechanism
- Implement issue statistics and assignment statistics functionality
- Update usage documentation

## Challenges Encountered
- Type definitions for Zod integration with MCP SDK in TypeScript
- Module path references need to add .js suffix
- Error handling needs to consider multiple scenarios
- Caching mechanism needs to balance real-time performance and efficiency
- Statistics functionality needs to handle large amounts of data and different dimensions

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests and integration tests
- Optimize error handling and edge cases
- Optimize caching mechanism
- Improve documentation and usage examples
