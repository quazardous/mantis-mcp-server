# System Patterns

## Architectural Decisions
- Adopt RESTful API design for clear interfaces
- Implement MVC architecture to separate concerns
- Use modular design for easy maintenance and expansion
- Use middleware to handle authentication and logging
- Implement caching mechanism to improve performance

## Design Patterns
- Singleton Pattern: For database connections and configuration management
- Factory Pattern: For creating Mantis API clients
- Decorator Pattern: For API validation and logging
- Strategy Pattern: For implementing different statistical algorithms
- Observer Pattern: For system event notifications

## Technical Debt
- Need to add more statistics and analysis features in later stages
- May need to optimize performance for large data queries
- Initial version lacks complete unit test coverage

## Best Practices
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Use environment variables for configuration management
- Implement API versioning
- Perform regular security updates
- Ensure code follows SOLID principles
